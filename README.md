This is a small business card project created by a beginner learning HTML and CSS. It displays a basic profile layout with an image, name, skill set, and location using simple flexbox layout and gradients.

I made this project to practice:

    Using HTML structure (div, ul, img, etc.)

    Applying CSS styles like flexbox, gradients, shadows, and spacing

    Organizing content in a clean card layout

Itâ€™s not mobile responsive yet, but I plan to improve it as I learn more!
